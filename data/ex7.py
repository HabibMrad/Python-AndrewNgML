#  Exercise 7 | Principle Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering
#
#  Instructions
#  ------------
#
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
#
#     pca.m
#     projectData.m
#     recoverData.m
#     computeCentroids.m - completed
#     findClosestCentroids.m - completed
#     kMeansInitCentroids.m - completed
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
#
## Imports
## ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
#  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
#  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
#  part, you should complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 
#

print('Finding closest centroids.')
